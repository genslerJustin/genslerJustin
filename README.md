- 👋 Hi, I’m @genslerJustin.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can from every resource available to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to navigate the dense forest of all things CS. I am honestly not sure where I want to start. I just know that I want to learn as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m focused on learning as much as possible, but I would like to work on projects that are willing to work with someone who is eager to learn.
- 📫 I can be reached at justin.t.gensler@gmail.com.
